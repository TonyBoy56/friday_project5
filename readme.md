## Description

_Link to gh-pages branch_
_https://assassin56.github.io/friday_project3/_

_This is a webpage that allows the user to input a number and give back a list of numbers from 0 to their input. The 1s, 2s, and 3s are to be replaced with silly phrases that would imitate a robot._

## SPEC Sheet

* Create a function that determines the range from 0 to any number based on user-input.
   * Input: function range(inputtedInteger)
   * Output: Push counter variable created inside the function to array.
      * Loop Counter until <= the value of the user-input.
      * Push until equal.
      * Return the array
* Store, in an array, the range from 0 to an inputted number by the user.
   * Input: Example [24]
   * Output: array1 = [0, 1,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9 , 10... 24]
* Pass this array to another for-loop within the same function. This will replace the following values with the specified phrases in the array: 
  [1]: "Beep!"
  [2]: "Boop!"
  [3]: "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
   * Input: Example [24]
   * Output: array = [0, "Beep", "Boop", "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep"... "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]
* Upon user submition, return array as text to the webpage.
   * Input: Example [24]
   * Output: array = [0, "Beep", "Boop", "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep"... "I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]
